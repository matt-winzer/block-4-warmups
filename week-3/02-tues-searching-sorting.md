## Questions

* What is a temporary variable and why are they important?
  - Variable that allows you to store a value for swapping
  - Holds a value that will be overwritten on following line
* Write a swapping function
  - Example is in Learn
* What is a linear search algorithm/how does it work?
  - Method for finding particular value of array
  - Linear => start at front of array and move through sequentially
  - If we find the correct value, return the index (break the loop)
  - Big O = O(n)
    * Depends on length of array 
* Write a linear search algorithm
  - Pseudocode in Learn

* STRETCH: What is a binary search algorithm/how does it work?
  - Splits array in half
  - Keep cutting in half
  - Big: O(log n)
